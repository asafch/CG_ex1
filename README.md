# Computer Graphics, exercise 1

The purpose of this exercise is to use some basic filters in image processing.
A `256*256 px` bitmap grayscale image is loaded, and presented in the top-left quadrant of a window.
The image is passed through 3 filters:
 1. A [Sobel edge detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) filter, presented in the top-right quadrant of the window
 2. A [half-toning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone) filter, presented in the bottom-left quadrant of the window
 3. A [Floyd-Steinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floydâ€“Steinberg_dithering) dithering filter (8-bit grascale 0> 2-bit grayscale), presented in the bottom-right quadrant of the window

The path to the source image is given as `argv[1]`.
The pixel values of each respective image are written to respective text files, which paths should be hardwired in the code.
